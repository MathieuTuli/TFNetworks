# Tensorflow Networks
**TFNetworks** is a series of various networks built in TensorFlow.

## Why?
It started out as a way of learning TensorFlow more in depth. Historically I hate using high-level libraries like Keras because I don't know what's fully going on in the background, so this serves as a Keras-like library while also providing me with the knowledge of what's going on in the background.

It was going to be an API of sorts, and eventuall I would like it to be, but I have found it challenging to build an API that works for a diverse set of situations. Hence, this project will built up to that, starting out mostl isolated but becoming more whole as I begin to identify similarities across use cases.
