# Tensorflow Networks
**TFNetworks** is an easy to use API for building various types of networks in TensorFlow.

## Why?
It started out as a way of learning TensorFlow more in depth. Historically I hate using high-level libraries like Keras because I don't know what's fully going on in the background, so this serves as a Keras-like while also providing me with the knowledge of what's going on in the background.

## How does it work?
- [x] Layer by layer building
- [ ] From config file building


## TODO
- [ ] Training on Google Cloud ML
- [ ] CNN
- [ ] FFNN
- [ ] Restnet
- [ ] CapNet
